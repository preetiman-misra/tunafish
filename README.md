# Tunafish

A simple and minimal 3D game engine in C.

## Motivation

This is a learning project, not meant to be a production game engine.

## Why C? Why not C++/Rust?

C is supreme, C is great. I wanted to learn a proper programming language, not a convoluted superset with footguns in
its syntax. Rust is
great, but too verbose and too much compiler magic. C is simple.

## Supported Platforms

1. MacOS (What I use)
2. Linux (What I want to use, but I have an actual life)
3. Windows (Absolute shit, probably builds on it, don't know, don't care)

## Build Instructions

You can't see the cmake files? Use cmake. Figure it out. Use LLMs, don't be a little child and learn how to read and
build a
codebase like a big boy.

## Next steps

Use this as a base, improve upon it. Don't create issues and pull requests, I don't care about you or your opinions.
Just fork and build. I am an entrepreneur, not a software engineer. I don't have time to waste on your ideal project
state of something I have written.
